            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Momsgoogoo Foods was born from a simple belief: that the best food comes from the heart, 
              made with love, and shared with those we care about. Our journey began in a small kitchen 
              where traditional recipes were passed down through generations, each dish telling a story 
              of heritage and craftsmanship.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
              What started as family recipes shared among friends has grown into a passionate endeavor 
              to bring authentic, high-quality food products to tables everywhere. Our signature beef 
              pickles and Chicken Sinju represent the perfect blend of traditional methods and premium 
              ingredients.
